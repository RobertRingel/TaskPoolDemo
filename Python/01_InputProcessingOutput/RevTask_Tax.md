Topic: variables, calculations, printing

## Learning Task: What is the purpose of the code?

Read, analyse and run the given Python program. What is it's purpose?  
Write the text for a related programming task.

``` python
TAX_RATE = 19/100
price = float(input('real price [EUR]:'))
tax = TAX_RATE*price/(1+TAX_RATE)
print('assumed VAT:',int(TAX_RATE*100),'%')
print('real price included VAT:',tax,'EUR')
```

---------------------------------------
